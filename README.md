# Fairfares-Carpooling-Application

This project is a GUI based application built using JavaFX and Scenebuilder which will provide the users with an opportunity to participate in daily
pooling by providing the user with an option to login from the information that is already provided in the
database or a new user can signup and select either to be the vehicle driver or a passenger and participate in daily pooling. The user will
be then able to select his starting point (Home Address), destination point (Work address) and based on vacancy
appropriate passengers are added and pooled with vehicle driver with appropriate costs.
